# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è

This Python program demonstrates how to **read from a file, modify its contents, and write the results to a new file**.  
It also includes **error handling** to ensure smooth execution even when unexpected issues occur.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- Reads the content of a user-specified file.
- Modifies the content (example: converts text to uppercase).
- Saves the modified version in a **new file** with the prefix `modified_`.
- Handles common errors gracefully:
  - File not found
  - Permission errors
  - Other unexpected errors

---

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
1. The program asks the user for a filename.  
2. It attempts to read the file.  
3. The content is **modified** (currently converted to UPPERCASE).  
4. A new file is created with the modified content (e.g., `modified_notes.txt`).  
5. Any errors are caught and displayed in a friendly message.

## Example Run üñ•Ô∏è
Original file: `notes.txt`
